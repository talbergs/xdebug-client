TDD!!!

1. create test
2. just production code enough to pass

1. It creates codebase testable
2. Tests must be as decoupled from system as possible.

1. during TDD production code becomes only more generic (never more specific) and tests become more specific (more detailed)
2. Avoid GOLD - tests should avoid "central behaviour" for as long as possible.
